    "The purpose of this project is to design and evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm using the normalized LMS algorithm (or one of its variants) that will clean the desired input (speech plus noise) from the machine noise (input). This is an example of the interference canceling problem explained below."

    "Speech data is collected in a noisy room (loud vacuum cleaner) by two microphones: one on a table that captures speech with the vacuum cleaner noise (d(n)) and the other very close to the vacuum cleaner (n(n)) that basically has no speech. Even if you listen to d(n), the speech is barely audible, and the message is not understandable. The goal is to denoise d(n) and be able to understand the speech. It is suggested to use the signal n(n) as the input to the LMS algorithm and use d(n) as the desired response. "
